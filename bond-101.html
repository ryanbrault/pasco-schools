      <section><h1>Bond 101</h1>

<h2>How schools are funded</h2>

<p>School districts are funded from three main sources: the state, the federal government, and local levies and bonds.</p>

<p> Washington State has not redefined its funding model for public education since 1977. Many basic needs, such as textbooks and technology to help students learn, are not fully funded. Nearly all of the state&#39;s 295 school districts must ask their local communities to cover about 20 percent of basic needs by approving local levies. </p>

<p> These levies support instruction, smaller class sizes, school bus transportation, safety and health, and technology for student learning.</p>

<h2>Maintenance and Operations Levy</h2>

<p>This levy also covers the state&#39;s shortfall for special education, highly capable learners, English language learners, advanced placement and honors courses, extra-curricular activities such as arts and athletics, and much more.</p>

<h2>What is a levy?</h2>

<p>Levies are intended to cover on-going costs for the district. By asking the taxpayers to approve a levy, the district is saying that the funding from its other sources (state and federal funding) does not cover the cost of offering the quality of education that it wants to provide the community. It is asking the taxpayers to kick in additional funds to fill the gap. The state limits the term of these levies to four years, which means that the district will have to go back to the voters every few years to retain the same level of spending and standard of education.</p>

<h2>Property value and levies</h2>

<p>School districts do not receive more money as property values increase. Levies are based on a fixed dollar amount, not a percentage of assessed property value. When voters approve a levy, they authorize the school district to collect a fixed dollar amount. So, as property values increase and more people share in paying that fixed amount, the combined local tax rate for schools stays about the same or often decreases.</p>
