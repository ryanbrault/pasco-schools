      <section><h1>Levy 101</h1>

<h2>What is a bond?</h2>

<p>A bond is very limited in how it can be used. Specifically, it can be used to buy land or to build or renovate school facilities. </p>

<p>These projects are understandably quite expensive and to fund them over the short term required by the other levy types would be cost prohibitive for the taxpayers. </p>

<p>Therefore, the school district asks for approval from the taxpayers to essentially take out a loan (by issuing bonds) which the taxpayers will pay back over the life of the loan (typically 30 years).</p>

<h2>Can bond money be used for classroom expenses? No!</h2>

<p>Although tax payers can approve hundreds of millions of dollars to build and renovate schools, bond dollars must be used exclusively for those purposes. </p>

<p>(For example, the Issaquah School District was able to build Liberty High School in the 1970s after voters approved a bond but had to wait a year to open the schools until voters approved a Maintenance and Operations levy to fund salaries and classroom operations).</p>
